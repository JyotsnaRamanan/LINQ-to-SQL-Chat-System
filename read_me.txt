This is a sample chat system involving 'n' number of persons in a chat room. 
This project was developed using the concept of  'LINQ-to-SQL'. 
The backend used here is 'MySQL'.
The User Names and the coversations among the users are saved in a database. 
The program is coded in ASP.net using C#. 
Default.aspx is the login page. 
When a user logs in, he/she is directed to the chatroom, which is the 'Chatroom.aspx.cs' file. 
For now, the code may throw some errors as it is running on a different system.
